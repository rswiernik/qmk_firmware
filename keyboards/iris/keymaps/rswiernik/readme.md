Rswiernik Standard Mapping
=========
[Sorta kinda... The Iris is weird ok...]

This layout combines come ideas that I've already incorporated into the layouts for my 60% and 75% boards and combines them with the layout that I used with my Planck. I'm still trying to figure out what is best on this board, but I think that this comes closest to the muscle memory that I already have while still being reasonable for the Iris.
